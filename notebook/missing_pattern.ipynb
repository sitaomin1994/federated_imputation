This creates problems when using the sigmoid function for the score_to_probability_func. Currently our solution is as follows: if there is just one candidate with a sum score 0, we will ampute it. If there is one candidate with a nonzero sum score, or multiple candidates with the same score, we evenly apply as if MCAR.\n"
